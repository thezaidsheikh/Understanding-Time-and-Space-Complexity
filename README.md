# Understanding-Time-and-Space-Complexity
As a developer you are already familier with the terms Space and Time Complexity. All good companies asks question regarding this concepts as a good developer follows and write code in scalable and readable manner.
Good Code have :- 
1. Readability
2. Scalability

## Readable Code
Readable code means your code should be understandable and readable to all. There should be clean code so that a new developer can also understand what you doing wih your code.

## Scalable Code
Scalable code means that if the input size increases how's your execution time and how much heap memory it is taking. Scalability is the main thing where many developer fails to deliver and even don't know what does that mean.

As we already know different computers have different CPU and RAM. Some are fast , some are slow, some are faster and some are slower. So, Earlier when developers write code in their machine the code run fast but in another machine it is executing slower. So to measure the time and space complexity of any code or to measure the good code a standard is introduced which is called Big O.

Now we use Big O ( O(n) ) to measure the complexities and to measure how's is the code performing.

Time complexity is used to measure the time execution time of the code.
Space complexity is use to measure the memory taken by the code.

There are different types of Big O notations to measure Time and Space
1. Big O of 1 ( O(1) )
2. Big O of n ( O(n) )
3. Big O of log n ( O(logn) )
4. Big O of n^2 ( O(n^2) )
5. Big O of n! ( O(n!) )

What causes time compleity 
1. Operations (+, -, *, /)
2. Conditions (<, >, ==)
3. Looping (for loop, while)
4. Function call (function())
